# Online_Fraud_Detection
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect online fraud in real-time. The model will be trained on historical transaction data, which will include both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The model will then be deployed to monitor new transactions and flag any suspicious activity in real-time.

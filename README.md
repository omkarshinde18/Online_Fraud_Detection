# Online_Fraud_Detection
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect online fraud in real-time. The model will be trained on historical transaction data, which will include both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The model will then be deployed to monitor new transactions and flag any suspicious activity in real-time.
# The project will involve the following steps:

### - Data collection: 
Gather and clean data from the online databases, such as public fraud data and customer behavior data.

### - Feature engineering: 
Select and transform the relevant features that are most predictive of online fraud, such as transaction amount, transaction location, customer device, and time of day.

### - Model selection and training: 
Evaluate logistic regression model, to get the performance of model.

### - Model evaluation and optimization: 
Validate the model's performance using statistical metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
